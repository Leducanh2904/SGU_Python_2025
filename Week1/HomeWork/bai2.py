# 2. Five Star Retro Video rents VHS tapes and DVDs to the same connoisseurs who like to
# buy LP record albums. The store rents new videos for $3.00 a night, and oldies for $2.00 a
# night. Write a program that the clerks at Five Star Retro Video can use to calculate the total
# charge for a customerâ€™s video rentals. The program should prompt the user for the number
# of each type of video and output the total cost.
